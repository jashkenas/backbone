Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

Nontechnical Description - *What to Use Backbone for and When to Use It*   
Backbone.js is useful for building JavaScript client-side applications. In the midst of adding more functionality to an app and tying data to the DOM, code is at risk of becoming tangled and unmanageable, resulting with what is known as *spaghetti code*. Backbone makes code maintainable; it provides a solid structure guided by data-managing Models and Views that present data to users.
