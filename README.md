Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

# What's In The Box?

* **Models** - Containers for application data featuring built-in sync with REST services and change events
* **Collections** - Containers for models that handle loading and saving new models, and provide helper functions for working with lists of models
* **Views** - Render your models and listen for events
* **Events** - Give any object the ability to publish or subscribe to events
* **Router** - Provides methods for routing client-side pages, and connecting them to actions and events

And much more, all in under ~8kb packed and gzipped.
