  <p>
    When working on a web application that involves a lot of JavaScript, one
    of the first things you learn is to stop tying your data to the DOM. It's all
    too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as tangled piles of
    jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically to keep data in
    sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the database on your
    server. For rich client-side applications, a more structured approach
    is often helpful.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With Backbone, you represent your data as
    <a href="#Model">Models</a>, which can be created, validated, destroyed,
    and saved to the server. Whenever a UI action causes an attribute of
    a model to change, the model triggers a <i>"change"</i> event; all
    the <a href="#View">Views</a> that display the model's data are notified of the
    event, causing them to re-render. You don't have to write the glue
    code that looks into the DOM to find an element with a specific <i>id</i>,
    and update the HTML manually
    &mdash; when the model changes, the views simply update themselves.
